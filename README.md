# Expense-Reimbursement-System

The Expense Reimbursement System (ERS) manages the process of reimbursing employees for expenses incurred while on company time. All employees can log in and submit requests for reimbursement and view their past tickets and pending requests. Managers can then log in and view all reimbursement requests and past history for all employees. These managers are authorized to approve and deny requests for expense reimbursements.

# Environment / Technologies 
Servlets, Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, JDBC, SQL, AJAX, Bootstrap, RDS, Tomcat, Git, Maven, Amazon RDS. 

# To Run this project
First you'll need to create a Postgres RDS instance on Amazon, then from their you'll need to create the tables required for this project see code for more details. 
Next you'll need to set up environment variables on your machine to point to your RDS URI along with the username and password for the database and make sure that use the same names as the ones used in the repository so that the connections are properly set and the table manipulation works as well. 
Finally you'll need to host a local Tomcatt server that the .war file will run on then just go to the localhost:8080/ and enjoy the application. If you have any questions feel free to email me a coltonkrantz@gmail.com. Thanks Have a great day!
